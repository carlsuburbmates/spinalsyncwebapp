# Service Worker & API Validation Notes

This reference explains how offline caching and server-side validation currently work so future changes remain consistent.

## Service Worker (`public/service-worker.js`)

### Purpose
Provide offline-first caching for critical emergency and guideline pages so clinicians can access key protocols without connectivity.

### Key Concepts
- **Cache versioning:** `CACHE_NAME` (e.g., `spinalsync-critical-v2`). Increment the suffix whenever caching logic or URL lists change to invalidate old entries.
- **Static URLs:** `STATIC_URLS` contains exact routes (e.g., `/emergency`, `/guidelines/bladder`) preloaded during the `install` phase.
- **Dynamic prefixes:** `CRITICAL_PREFIXES` (e.g., `/emergency/`, `/guidelines/`) determine whether a request should be cached at runtime.
- **Network fallback:** On a cache miss the worker fetches the request and stores a clone. If the network fails, the cached response (if any) is returned.
- **Non-GET requests:** Ignored to avoid caching mutations.

### Updating the Worker
1. Add new emergency/guideline routes to `STATIC_URLS` if they should be precached.
2. Extend `CRITICAL_PREFIXES` for new dynamic segments.
3. Bump `CACHE_NAME` to invalidate stale caches.
4. Rebuild and redeploy. Encourage users to refresh once to activate the new worker.

### Registration
- `components/service-worker-register.tsx` is a small client component rendered from `app/layout.tsx`. It registers the worker and logs errors in development.
- Server components must not call `useEffect`; keep the registration logic isolated in client components.

## API Route Validation

### Location
`app/api/*/route.ts` files handle Supabase CRUD operations for `badges`, `profiles`, `events`, `progress`, and `user_badges`.

### Patterns
- **Service-role client:** Created with `lib/supabase/server.ts`. Throws on missing credentials to surface configuration issues early.
- **Zod validation:** Each POST request uses a Zod schema (e.g., `badgeSchema`) and rejects invalid payloads with a `400` and `parsed.error.flatten()` details.
- **Column whitelisting:** Supabase `.select()` calls only return expected columns to avoid leaking internal fields.
- **Error handling:** Database errors return `500` with the Supabase message.
- **Client boundaries:** Client components should never instantiate Supabase directly with the service role key. They use `fetch("/api/...")`.

### Extending Schemas
1. Add new fields to the Zod schema and the JSON schema for the tool or payload.
2. Update the matching `select()` clause so responses include the new data.
3. Ensure RLS policies permit the required operations if using Supabase security.
4. Add or update tests under `__tests__/` to cover the new contract.

### Progress Endpoint Special Case
- `app/api/progress/route.ts` expects a `userId` query parameter for GET and uses `upsert` with composite keys (`user_id`, `sub_module_id`). Keep this in sync with Supabase table definitions in `.github/copilot-instructions.md`.

## Testing & Verification

- **Build-time type checks:** `pnpm build` will fail if API routes import client-only modules or if type guards break.
- **Runtime checks:** Use `__tests__/badges-api.test.ts` as a template when adding new endpoints. Tests assume the dev server is running locally.
- **Manual QA:** Verify client flows after schema changes (e.g., badges grid, quick access cards) and check the service worker caches new routes by inspecting Application â†’ Cache Storage in the browser dev tools.
