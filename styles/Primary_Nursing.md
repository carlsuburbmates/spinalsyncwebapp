This e-Booklet is targeted at the primary nurse who is or has limited experience in the role. The aim is to provide a good understanding of the role and describe the education required, the processes that need to take place & resources available to ensure a safe & effective complex discharge of the patient into their community.
 
 
“Primary nursing refers to a client-focused care-delivery system, in which nurses manage the progress of a client through an episode of care in a nursing unit. Numerous reports have
proclaimed it’s benefit as a modality of care. Primary nursing is believed to result in higher
quality of nursing care & patient satisfaction.” (Hoffmann-Kusk & Groenkjaer, 2016)

The Primary Nursing model of Nursing care ensures a comprehensive, individualised patient focused rehabilitation for each patient that comes through Spinal Rehabilitation Facility (SRF). The Primary Nurse (PN) works with the patient and their treating team to set goals that will allow for a safe and timely discharge. Primary nursing offers extensive spinal cord injury (SCI) education and provides supports/resources to the patient and their family & any other relevant support networks. This allows the patient to understand and manage their own injury, and ultimately feel confident to transition back into the community with this new injury. When applied successfully, the primary nursing model of care can contribute to an increase in quality of life and reduce/prevent further admissions to hospital for the patient.
Briefly, the following are the responsibilities of the Primary Nurse:
•	Providing education on SCI to the patient with open communication to support them through their rehabilitation experience
•	Monitoring of the patient’s Skin, Bladder and Bowel management (inc. adjusting care needs as required)
•	Working with the Multidisciplinary Team (MDT) to achieve & encourage the optimal functional potential specific to the patient
•	Contributes to a timely, safe and organised discharge process where the patient feels supported to integrate back into their home & community
•	Arranging equipment trials and prescribing continence equipment – NDIS/TAC/Non- comp
•	Referrals made as required/ appropriate
•	Attends and contributes to the patient’s Team & Goal Planning meetings
 
 
The primary nursing role can seem complex and overwhelming. It is a very patient specific and patient centred approach. It takes time to understand and master the role of a Primary Nurse.

The key is to remember you are not alone and to remain open to learning about this type of complex discharge planning. In fact even the most experienced PN will tell you that there is something to learn with every patient that you assist & that it’s really important to continually be accessing your resources and have clear communication with your team and primary patient.

As a PN you will need:
•	An understanding of Spinal Cord Injury. ATLAS is a great resource for this. Ensure you’re enrolled into ward’s Specialty Practice Framework- ‘SRF- Foundation’ under ‘My Learning’ tab- try clicking above link or see screenshot for reference below.

*	If you’re not enrolled, please let you Nurse Unit Manager (NUM) and/or email atlassupport@austin.org.au
•	Skills in providing education. This requires competence and confidence. To gain competence you need an understanding about different learning and teaching styles, observing senior SRF nurses provide education sessions, utilise this booklet’s education resources & complete relevant External Teaching Resources to achieve this. Confidence will come with time and experience, remember it’s not a formal
lecture it’s an information session that is relevant to the patient and their SCI injury.
•	Understand the Victorian Spinal Cord Service (VSCS) and what services are available for SCI patients.
•	Know the patient – Level of lesion, ASIA score, associated injuries, expected
outcomes and functional potential, patient’s health & life goals- these can be found
in the patient’s EMR notes or in consultation with Team Leaders/ ANUM team
 
•	Know the treating team to make team goals together – Medical-consultant & registrar, ANUM (Team Leader), Social worker, PT, OT, Psych support/s, Leisure and Dietitian.
•	Know the patient’s source of compensation & what is involved with that nursing discharge process- TAC/NDIS/Non-Comp. This information can be found in Current Patients folder.
•	Understand referral processes needed eg internally within Austin Health to address specific health needs & externally such as wound or catheter care providers for ongoing care post discharge.
Tip: You will require access to “Tspinl” folder on Sharepoint as well SRF Specialty Practice Framework (as mentioned). They are two separate accesses, please request both from your NUM.

You will need to:

•	Firstly, introduce self to patient and support network/s. This is one of the ways to begin building rapport with your patient which is a critical initial first step. Evidence suggests that building a rapport with your patient can improve a patient’s health, increase feelings of empowerment, security and confidence. This engagement also strengthens compliance and can decrease length of stay and readmission too (Maryville University, 2022)
•	Ways to build rapport with your patient are:
o	Get to know the patient personally without crossing professional boundaries
o	Maintain cultural respect & nil judgements are made in each interaction
o	Provide eye contact if (culturally appropriate) be respectful when discussing their care and concerns
o	Educate them where possible regarding their queries &minimise jargon talk by using wording they can relate to.
o	Make sure needs and coordination of care are met to the best of your ability, safely & within hospital policy.
o	Use open ended questions to understand the patient’s communication style
o	Practice active listening. This is when you focus on what the patient is saying at the time then summarise & reflect on what they say or ask for clarification when necessary.
•	Discuss and/or assess the patient’s learning style as we all learn differently. The External Teaching Resources is a great resource to learn for you to gain an
 
understand of these styles. The preferred & most effective style/s of learning will impact on how much the patient learns.
o	Styles include: - Visual, Aural, Read/Write & Kinesthetics (known as VARK)
o	Assessment: can be as simple as asking the patient how they’d like their education presented or using a tool such as the VARK Questionnaire coupled with VARK Questionnaire Scoring Chart to evaluate the answers.
o	It’s important to mention that most people will have more than one way they learn best known as multimodal learning & therefore a combined approach will be most effective eg Visual & Aural= talking through the education and using appropriate pictures/ models/ sample products.
•	Assess patient’s literacy ability & utilise methods such as the Teach Back Method to ensure information is delivered effectively to the patient. It is important that you teach to their literacy level & use a reliable method, so you know they have absorbed and understood the education provided.


Bedside education/support
When nursing your primary patient or any patient on shift your aim should be support, educate, inform, empower and encourage them to work towards their rehabilitation goals as you provide their care.

Some topics and examples of this type of nursing support to provide are:

Emotional Wellbeing
-	Provide space and opportunity for the patient to discuss their feelings
-	Offer professional bedside support & reassurance, and wider services that the VSCS & Austin Health can provide the patient eg psychology, sexual health, peer support, volunteers & spiritual/religious supports. You could also consider discussing day leave/ SLUs in with the Team Leading ANUMs and Medical team if appropriate for the concern.
Bladder and bowel management
-Discuss & support with types: IMC/IDC/SPC/VOS
-Discuss trialling of different equipment eg Speedicath, syphon bag.
-Inform & discuss resources such as https://mybladdermylife.com/
-Educate & explain if they have a flaccid or reflex bowel & what that means for their regime eg frequency of routine:
-reflex- daily or second daily.
-flaccid- BD
 
-Discuss the use of Aperients & importance of Diet
-Empower, educate & support with troubleshooting bowel regime eg how to reduce bowel accidents.
-Teach & support patient with Practical bowel skills.

Skin Management
-Educate and demonstrate how to perform a skin check & when eg at the start of the day, after the commode, retiring to bed at night and if concerned.
-Educate how to assess the blanching of reddened skin eg capillary refill & what to do if a reddened pressure area has been identified eg get off the bony prominent area until healed.
-Educate & support with the importance of pressure relief techniques & frequency when mobilising in a wheelchair eg hourly tilting back or lifts
-Educate importance of pressure relief when returning to bed lying on a side prior to going supine to provide sacral and natal cleft relief.
-Educate & support how to best try new clothes & shoes that may cause pressure injury eg wear for one hour, then perform a skin check.
-Promote skin safety regarding pressure, burns, stoma care, maceration & friction risks that the patient could encounter whilst you nurse them.

Activities of daily living
-	Educate, support & promote independence with patient performing what they can of their ADLs
-	Highlight the importance of practicing to improve, strengthen & to be open to do different ways in approach to task
-	If the patient is unable to perform task/s teach & empower the patient on how to best direct their care to another person to avoid frustration and/ omitting care eg a carer to make a cup of tea how the patient would like
-	Highlight the safety aspect in each ADL activity. This can be done by explaining what and why they need to perform an ADL in a certain way eg testing of hot water on patient’s shoulder (or where they can feel it) to prevent a burn prior to spraying entire body with water, casters facing forward on wheelchair/ commode for slide board transfer, knowing which side the leg bag needs to be on each day to avoid pressure injury &/or filleting.

Medications
-Educate patients on what they’ll be taking & how the medication works, particularly with bowel, bladder, pain & spasm medications.
-Discuss Self Medication Program (if appropriate) with ANUM and Registrar. PN to complete Self Medication Program (SMP) on ATLAS & review the policy for your own learnings.
Tip: Pharmacy can supply an information sheet in an easy-to-read format as a teaching aid or tool for SMP

Equipment
-Encourage to trial lots of different equipment eg splints, slide boards, syphon bags, catheters, beds, wheelchairs etc.
-Support MDT trials that occur & document progress accordingly.
 
-When doing your first continence script, do it with or have it checked by a senior PN, your Team Leader or the patient’s allocated SCIS nurse.
-Then go through with the patient & teach them how to order their continence equipment & how to liaise with their NDIS Support Coordinator or TAC Coordinator who will order for the patient.
-Inform patient of recommended Continence ordering websites to browse: https://www.independenceaustralia.com.au/
https://www.brightsky.com.au/ (Workcover clients: be guided by current product list of approved items- ask Team Leader or SCIS nurse for location of this list)

Primary Nursing Education – Group vs individual

Whilst on SRF the patient should also be offered SCI education on an Individual (one on one) basis from the allocated Primary Nurse/s as well as in a Group setting. The following describes the individual and group sessions in further detail:

Individual Primary Nurse Education

As outlined your role is to ensure the patient has an understanding of their SCI. The following topics need to be covered in the rehabilitation phase prior to discharge by the primary nurse:

-Spinal Cord Injury- level of lesion; ASIA; functional potential; Spinal Shock; Autonomic dysreflexia; associated injury; pain & neuropathic pain; respiratory changes/ needs ie assist cough, chest physio, ventilator management
-Neurogenic bladder- anatomy & physiology; optimal management; management options inc. practical skills & medications; complications; baseline tests; troubleshooting skills
-Neurogenic bowel- anatomy & physiology; importance of a regime; types of regimes; establishing a regime; Diet/nutrition education & impact; Practical skills & use of medications; troubleshooting skills
-Skin management- anatomy & physiology associated with SCI; importance of checking skin and performing regular pressure area care; how to perform skin checks and pressure relief; posture and positioning importance; highlight concerns for pressure (eg clothing, environments and surfaces)
-Sexual Health & Body image- raise this topic & discuss importance of sexual health & relationships; educate/ refer to sexual health counsellor. For Sexual Health Referral form- click here
-SCI complications- educate patient on common & relevant SCI complications (see list below). Aim: to critically think and solve any real, or hypothesized problems that they have or may experience with their injury.
List of complications outlined:
*Autonomic Dysreflexia (if relevant)
*Auto thermoregulation- Hyperthermia & Hypothermia
*Venous Thrombosis Embolism- DVT & PE
*Respiratory infections
*Skin- Pressure staging; tinea; ingrown toenails; groin & penile care; burns; hypersensitivity.
*Bladder- infection; stones; bleeding/trauma inc. skin; blocked /unable to pass a catheter
 
*Bowel- Constipation & Diarrhoea
*Heterotopic Ossification
*Ascending & Descending Cystic Myelopathy (Syrinx)
*Spasticity
*Pathological Fractures

These topics don’t need to be formal session but rather an informative conversation in a private, non distracting space that allows the patient to gain an understanding and feel comfortable to ask questions.
Tips:
•	If the patient isn’t in a single room book the ward’s Patient Education room (opposite Beds 5/6) using the designated diary at the ANUM desk.
•	Book your sessions in consultation with your patient and have them added into their therapy timetable. To do this have an ANUM to make the booking on the patient’s timetable for you.
•	For an education check list and approximate timeline please see Primary Nurse Checklist
•	Remember your Team Leading ANUMs are great resources to support you in making an education plan
There may be additional educational needs that you discover along the way & will need to address. Remember to utilise Austin Health’s resources if requiring additional information eg stoma care nurse for product review. Also see Referral section on page 12
 
Group Education Sessions for SCI Patients
SRF also runs group education sessions called Topic of the Week (TOW). There are a range of health care professionals and peers with lived experience that collaboratively present the session which makes it an informative and meaningful way for patients to learn more about their SCI. The sessions run each Wednesday 3-4pm with a different topic each week that broadly covers but relevant to all SCI patients.
There is approximately 10 topics on continuously on repeat which are:

Topic 1: Rehab Journey
Topic 2: Spinal Cord and SCI
Topic 3: Bladder Health
Topic 4: Nutrition
Topic 5: Bowel
Topic 6: Skin
Topic 7: Sexual Health
Topic 8: Pain/Spasms/AD
Topic 9: Life After Rehab
Topic 10: Mental Health

Please encourage your patient to attend this program as well your PN individual education sessions.

Tip: After your patient has attended a TOW it’s timely to do a follow up conversation with them to assess if there are any questions or knowledge gaps to address & to also re- highlight what is relevant to them & their injury level from that session.

*It’s important to access the Patient Education Resources as it contains teaching resources for the PN and succinct patient handouts that can be passed on.
 
 
Creating goals together with the patient is an integral part of the PN role. This requires regular assessment, planning, implementation & evaluation to occur ideally with the patient & fellow colleagues. The Clinical Reasoning Cycle and Nursing Process cycle are good resources to utilise to achieve this:



An example of how to utilise the Nursing process cycle regarding patient nursing education to be provided would be:
-Assess
-	the patient’s engagement, needs and progress each shift when you interact with
the patient
-	find out what the patient’s rehab goals & concerns are that need addressing
-	their level of understanding with each interaction/ topic discussed with them
 
-Plan
 
-	triage & prioritise education needs for the patient
-	the education sessions with the patient using the SRF timetabling system- see ANUM for guidance
-	time to collaborate with fellow nurses & treating team regarding education needs, equipment trials, referrals required to achieve rehab goals.
 
-Implement & Evaluate
- the plan and alter (add/subtract needs) as you go based on your evaluation & patient and peer feedback

*Keep repeating the above process with each topic in conjunction with the patient & treating team to achieve a comprehensive patient centred & safe discharge. The Team
 
Leading ANUMs are also there if you feel unsure or require support with this ongoing process.
Tips:
-	You may not be allocated to nurse your patient on shift and therefore it is advantageous to do a weekly catch up with your primary patient one on one for 30 minutes. This can support them and assist you with your assessments and goal setting ongoingly.
-	Use the same cycle approach with discharge paperwork- see Discharge paperwork information from page 8 onwards.


Each patient has a weekly Ward Round with their treating Consultant, Registrar and Team Leading ANUM. Days of the week for Ward Rounds are Mondays, Tuesdays & Thursdays. As PN it is not expected you attend this round but you choose to some times otherwise you can obtain findings from your Team Leading ANUM afterwards. There is 1 consultant, 1 registrar & 2 ANUMs allocated to each of the 3 Spinal Consultant Teams.

Your Team Leading ANUMs are great resources & it is a part of their roles to support you in all aspects of the primary nursing role.
Other relevant meetings that a PN attends on the respective Ward Round day of the primary patient are:

Team Meetings- from 2.30pm onwards
Team meetings occur approximately every 2-4 weeks via Teams. The MDT comes together to discuss progress towards discharge without the attendance of the patient. This allows for clear communication between team members and effective collaboration. Each patient has a “First Team meeting” where each discipline states the expected outcome of the patient upon discharge. Some examples of this initial discussion are, ADLs- Independence level & if carers will be required, Bladder Management, Home modifications needed (if known), Mobility- will ambulate or require a wheelchair/s & Funding status. This gives a rough timeline for how long a patient will remain in rehabilitation. These aspects are then continuously reviewed at all future Team meetings.
Goal Planning Meetings- from 3.30-4pm or 4-4.30pm
Goal Planning Meetings occur approximately every 4-6 weeks on a Monday, Tuesday or Thursday that reflect the patient’s Consultant ward day (eg Mon- McFarlane, Tues- Nunn & Thurs- Clements). The team, patient and their family come together and discuss progress and barriers towards achieving goals. Goals are created with the patient and each team member prior to the Goal Planning Meeting relating to each discipline ie. Nursing goals
 
could include managing bladder/bowel/skin independently. This allows for structure to the patient and their family within their rehabilitation journey. The estimated discharge date is also discussed with the patient and their family to give them a rough timeline for their rehabilitation.

Your role is to attend all Team and Goal Planning meetings planned for your patient and contribute to the nursing topics and goals (eg skin, bladder & bowel predominantly). You’re not expected to know or provide information on behalf of another MDT member eg give a Medical update.
Tip: If unable to attend please initiate a discussion with your ANUM Team Leaders & provide written electronic notes of what needs to be stated at these meetings.

Referrals –
Some standard referrals as a PN you can expect to make are IDC/SPC & wound dressing changes. These are external, not Austin, companies that manage this in the community. The SCIS nurse does not perform any of these changes and therefore these referrals should be done as soon as known or at least 2 weeks prior to the patient’s discharge from SRF. Other referrals such as sexual health, leisure, dietician, speech pathology & psych are done internally. Please consult your shift ANUM if unsure of how to source or place these referrals.
Tip: if not a referral that is made on Cerner, most referral processes are found in the Current Patients folder.

Discharge Paperwork – All discharge paperwork is found on Austin Health’s Sharepoint- Discharge Planning >Current Patients folder &( can and) should be commenced early in the admission (ASAP)by the allocated PN and not left to the week of discharge.
All patients require a Discharge Summary and Community Living Plan (CLP) to be completed. The relevant forms for Continence Equipment Prescription & referrals (if needed) depends on the patient’s type of compensation but can also be found in the above Discharge Planning folder link.

Tips:
-	The Ward Clerk or ANUM will usually set up the patient’s folder in the Current Patients folder on admission so you should be able to source all the relevant Discharge Paperwork. Please consult your Team Leading ANUM if you believe it to be incorrect prior to changing it yourself.
-	Remember your Team Leading ANUMs are great resources to support you in ensuring all necessary Discharge paperwork is complete & to prioritise what order to complete in. It is best to start discharge paperwork as soon as you are assigned to your primary patient and not leave it to the last minute!
-	The patient is also allocated Spinal Community Integration Service (SCIS) nurse who is also an excellent resource to reach out to and do the Continence discharge script together (highly recommended). To find out who this nurse is please ask your Team Leader ANUMs.
 
Types of compensation – as already described it’s important to know types of compensation as it effects the type of paperwork needed to be done by the PN.

-	Comp (TAC/Work cover)
TAC (Transport Accident Commission) –If your patient has sustained their injury because of a road or work accident, they will be compensated by the Transport Accident Commission (TAC). All TAC patients are assigned a TAC coordinator. All TAC paperwork is sent to the coordinator.
Examples of relevant TAC/ Workcover forms for Nursing are found here
-	Non-Comp – NDIS or SWEP/CAPS
Patients are eligible for NDIS if they are under 65years and have a disability. They must not be receiving compensation of any type from another organisation (eg TAC).

Those not eligible for TAC or NDIS can get funding from the State Wide Equipment Program (SWEP) and Continence Aids Program (CAPS) – These funding bodies may not cover all expenses for equipment, home modifications and care, and it’s up to the patient to fill the gap.
Examples of relevant NDIS (Victoria) forms for Nursing are found here Examples of Non Compensable forms for Nursing are found here
-	Other types of compensation are:
*Tasmania MAIB clients- Nursing forms here
*	Tasmania NDIS clients- Nursing forms here

Tips:
-	The patient’s assigned Liaison or Social Worker will also know exactly which forms that require a nurse to complete & are a good resource for you to ask regarding the patient’s Compensation status.
-	As a general rule for interstate patients PNs usually only need to advise equipment and/or provide quotes but the process is individual so consult your Team Leading ANUMs regularly (eg fortnightly or via email) to ensure you are meeting discharge requirements.
 
 
-	Ask the patient regularly about needs/concerns related to SCI & resource/ address these in an appropriate time frame. As a minimum touch base with them weekly but you may find it is more often than this (that’s normal!).
-	Refer to and follow discharge Primary Nurse Checklist
-	Consult your Team Leader ANUM/s regularly to find out what needs to be done regularly eg weekly.
-	Consult other PNs, senior nursing staff (ie CNS & other ANUMs) to discuss what needs to be done/ is outstanding.
-	Liaise & review the patient with the Spinal Community Integration Service (located in level 2 office onsite)
-	View patient’s multidisciplinary treating team/ view team meeting & psychosocial notes in patient’s history
*Tip: Your aim is to review the work you’ve done and look for learning gaps weekly to address your patient’s needs in view of a thorough and safe discharge.
