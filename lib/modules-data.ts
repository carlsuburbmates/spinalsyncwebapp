            correct_answer: "At least every 2-3 hours",
            explanation:
              "Regular repositioning is crucial to relieve pressure from bony prominences. Waiting longer than 3 hours significantly increases the risk of tissue damage.",

            correct_answer: "Lifting their bottom completely off the cushion for 2-3 minutes",
            explanation:
              "A brief or partial shift is not enough. The tissue needs several minutes completely free of pressure for blood flow to be adequately restored.",
