        <h2>Introduction to Respiratory Changes After SCI</h2>
        <p>The respiratory system is significantly affected by spinal cord injury, particularly with cervical and high thoracic lesions. Understanding these changes is crucial for maintaining respiratory health, preventing complications, and optimizing quality of life after SCI. This module explains how different injury levels affect breathing, the muscles involved in respiration, and why respiratory care is a priority in SCI management.</p>
        <h3>Normal Respiratory Function</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Diaphragm:</strong> The primary muscle of inspiration, innervated by the phrenic nerves (C3-C5)</li>
          <li><strong>Intercostal muscles:</strong> Between the ribs, help expand the chest cavity (T1-T12)</li>
          <li><strong>Accessory muscles:</strong> Neck and shoulder muscles used during increased respiratory effort</li>
          <li><strong>Abdominal muscles:</strong> Important for coughing and forced expiration (T6-L1)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This coordinated muscle action allows for effective ventilation, adequate gas exchange, and protective reflexes like coughing.</p>
        <h3>How SCI Affects Respiratory Function</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Cervical Injuries (C1-C8):</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>C1-C2: Complete dependence on mechanical ventilation</li>
              <li>C3-C4: May require ventilatory support; some diaphragm function possible</li>
              <li>C5-C8: Diaphragm function usually preserved, but intercostal and abdominal muscle weakness leads to reduced lung volumes, weak cough, and fatigue with respiratory effort</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Thoracic Injuries (T1-T12):</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>T1-T6: Preserved diaphragm function, but loss of intercostal muscles affects chest wall stability and cough effectiveness</li>
              <li>T7-T12: Progressive preservation of respiratory muscles, but abdominal muscle weakness still impacts cough strength</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Lumbar and Sacral Injuries:</strong> Generally minimal impact on respiratory function; may have some weakness in abdominal muscles affecting cough</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Specific Respiratory Complications After SCI</h3>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Reduced Lung Volumes:</strong> Vital capacity can be reduced by 50-60% in high injuries; functional residual capacity decreases, leading to atelectasis</li>
          <li><strong>Impaired Cough Mechanism:</strong> Weak abdominal and intercostal muscles result in ineffective cough, difficulty clearing secretions, and increased infection risk</li>
          <li><strong>Sleep-Disordered Breathing:</strong> Sleep apnea is common, particularly in cervical injuries</li>
          <li><strong>Respiratory Infections:</strong> Pneumonia is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in SCI</li>
          <li><strong>Respiratory Fatigue:</strong> Increased work of breathing due to muscle weakness; diaphragm may become fatigued more easily</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Factors Affecting Respiratory Function</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Injury-related: Level and completeness, time since injury, associated injuries</li>
          <li>Individual: Age, fitness, smoking, pre-existing conditions, body weight, posture</li>
          <li>Environmental: Air quality, infections, access to care</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>The Importance of Respiratory Care</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Maintain adequate ventilation</li>
          <li>Prevent complications</li>
          <li>Optimize function</li>
          <li>Improve quality of life</li>
          <li>Support independence</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Australian Clinical Guidelines</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Regular assessment and monitoring</li>
          <li>Breathing exercises and airway clearance</li>
          <li>Vaccination programs</li>
          <li>Early mobilization and positioning</li>
          <li>Education for patients and caregivers</li>
          <li>Access to respiratory equipment</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>When to Seek Medical Attention</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Increased shortness of breath or difficulty breathing</li>
          <li>Changes in cough or sputum</li>
          <li>Fever with respiratory symptoms</li>
          <li>Chest pain or discomfort</li>

        <h2>Assessment Questions</h2>
        <div>
          <strong>Question 1:</strong> Which respiratory muscle is primarily affected in a C4 complete spinal cord injury?
          <ul>
            <li>A. Diaphragm only</li>
            <li>B. Intercostal muscles only</li>
            <li>C. Both diaphragm and intercostal muscles</li>
            <li>D. Accessory neck muscles only</li>
          </ul>
          <strong>Answer:</strong> C. Both diaphragm and intercostal muscles<br/>
          <em>Explanation:</em> A C4 complete injury affects both the diaphragm (innervated by C3-C5) and intercostal muscles (T1-T12), though some diaphragm function may be preserved. This significantly impacts breathing capacity and the ability to cough effectively.
        </div>
        <div>
          <strong>Question 2:</strong> Why are individuals with high thoracic SCI (T1-T6) at increased risk of respiratory infections?
          <ul>
            <li>A. They have complete diaphragm paralysis</li>
            <li>B. They have weak intercostal and abdominal muscles, reducing cough effectiveness</li>
            <li>C. They cannot breathe without mechanical ventilation</li>
            <li>D. They have increased metabolic demands</li>
          </ul>
          <strong>Answer:</strong> B. They have weak intercostal and abdominal muscles, reducing cough effectiveness<br/>
          <em>Explanation:</em> While the diaphragm remains functional in thoracic injuries, the loss of intercostal and abdominal muscle function significantly reduces the ability to cough effectively and clear secretions, increasing infection risk.
        </div>
        <div>
          <strong>Question 3:</strong> According to Australian clinical guidelines, what is a priority component of respiratory care after SCI?
          <ul>
            <li>A. Complete bed rest to conserve energy</li>
            <li>B. Avoiding all physical activity</li>
            <li>C. Regular breathing exercises and airway clearance techniques</li>
            <li>D. Using oxygen therapy for all patients</li>
          </ul>
          <strong>Answer:</strong> C. Regular breathing exercises and airway clearance techniques<br/>
          <em>Explanation:</em> Australian guidelines emphasize active respiratory care including breathing exercises and airway clearance to maintain lung function and prevent complications. Bed rest and activity avoidance can worsen respiratory function.
