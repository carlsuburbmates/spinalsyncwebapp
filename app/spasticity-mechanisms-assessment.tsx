        <h2>What is Spasticity?</h2>
        <p>Spasticity is a velocity-dependent increase in muscle tone due to upper motor neuron lesions, resulting in exaggerated tendon reflexes and involuntary muscle contractions. It can cause pain, contractures, and functional impairment in SCI patients.</p>
        <h3>Pathophysiology</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Loss of descending inhibitory signals from the brain</li>
          <li>Hyperexcitability of spinal reflex arcs</li>
          <li>Altered neurotransmitter balance (glutamate, GABA)</li>
          <li>Muscle and connective tissue changes</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Clinical Features</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Increased muscle tone (stiffness, resistance to movement)</li>
          <li>Clonus (rhythmic, involuntary contractions)</li>
          <li>Exaggerated deep tendon reflexes</li>
          <li>Spasms (sudden, involuntary movements)</li>
          <li>Pain, contractures, impaired mobility</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Assessment Tools</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS): grades resistance to passive movement</li>
          <li>Tardieu Scale: measures spasticity at different velocities</li>
          <li>Observation of functional impact (gait, transfers, ADLs)</li>
          <li>Patient/caregiver report of spasms, pain, triggers</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Differential Diagnosis</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Rigidity (Parkinsonism): not velocity-dependent</li>
          <li>Dystonia: sustained muscle contractions, abnormal postures</li>
          <li>Contractures: fixed shortening of muscles/tendons</li>
          <li>Myoclonus: brief, shock-like jerks</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Common Triggers</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Infections (UTI, pneumonia)</li>
          <li>Bladder/bowel distension</li>
          <li>Skin breakdown, pressure injuries</li>
          <li>Sudden movement, pain, stress</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Summary: Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Spasticity is common and disabling in SCI</li>
          <li>Assessment requires clinical scales and functional observation</li>
          <li>Triggers must be identified and managed</li>
          <li>Differentiation from other movement disorders is essential</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Assessment Questions</h2>
        <div>
          <strong>Question 1:</strong> Which of the following best describes spasticity in SCI?
          <ul>
            <li>A. Velocity-dependent increase in muscle tone due to upper motor neuron lesion</li>
            <li>B. Fixed muscle rigidity not affected by movement speed</li>
            <li>C. Sudden, brief muscle jerks</li>
            <li>D. Sustained abnormal postures</li>
          </ul>
          <strong>Answer:</strong> A. Velocity-dependent increase in muscle tone due to upper motor neuron lesion<br/>
          <em>Explanation:</em> Spasticity is defined by increased muscle tone that is velocity-dependent, distinguishing it from rigidity and other movement disorders.
        </div>
        <div>
          <strong>Question 2:</strong> What is the most commonly used clinical scale for grading spasticity?
          <ul>
            <li>A. Glasgow Coma Scale</li>
            <li>B. Modified Ashworth Scale</li>
            <li>C. Barthel Index</li>
            <li>D. Tardieu Scale</li>
          </ul>
          <strong>Answer:</strong> B. Modified Ashworth Scale<br/>
          <em>Explanation:</em> The Modified Ashworth Scale is the most widely used tool for grading resistance to passive movement in spasticity assessment.
        </div>
        <div>
          <strong>Question 3:</strong> Which of the following is NOT a common trigger for spasticity in SCI?
          <ul>
            <li>A. Bladder distension</li>
            <li>B. Skin breakdown</li>
            <li>C. Sudden movement or pain</li>
            <li>D. Fixed contracture</li>
          </ul>
          <strong>Answer:</strong> D. Fixed contracture<br/>
          <em>Explanation:</em> Fixed contracture is a consequence of chronic spasticity, not a trigger. Triggers include infection, bladder/bowel issues, skin breakdown, and pain.
