    <h1>Daily Bladder Management</h1>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> This module provides essential guidance on daily bladder management for individuals with spinal cord injury, focusing on maintaining urinary health, preventing complications, and promoting independence using evidence-based Australian clinical practices.</p>
    <h2>Introduction to Daily Bladder Management</h2>
    <p>Managing your bladder on a daily basis after a spinal cord injury (SCI) is crucial to protect your kidneys, prevent infections, and maintain your quality of life. The spinal cord injury affects how your bladder stores and empties urine, requiring a tailored bladder management routine. This guide will help you understand practical, safe, and effective daily bladder care based on Australian clinical guidelines from NSW Health ACI, Queensland SCIS, and Spinal Cord Injury Australia.</p>
    <h3>Understanding the Impact of SCI on Bladder Function</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Neurogenic bladder: may not fill or empty normally</li>
      <li>Urinary retention: incomplete emptying, infection risk</li>
      <li>Incontinence: involuntary leakage</li>
      <li>Risk of UTIs due to incomplete emptying or catheter use</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Key Principles of Daily Bladder Management</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Establish a Reliable Emptying Method</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Intermittent catheterization (preferred)</li>
          <li>Indwelling catheter</li>
          <li>Reflex voiding with condom catheter or pads</li>
          <li>Timed or prompted voiding</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Maintain a Regular Schedule</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Strict timetable (every 4-6 hours)</li>
          <li>Keep a bladder diary</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Hydration and Diet</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>1.5-2 litres water daily</li>

        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Hygiene and Infection Prevention</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Wash hands before/after catheterization</li>
          <li>Use clean/sterile catheters as advised</li>
          <li>Clean genital area daily</li>
          <li>Watch for UTI signs</li>
          <li>Report symptoms promptly</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Skin Care</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Check skin around catheter sites daily</li>
          <li>Use barrier creams if needed</li>
          <li>Avoid tight clothing</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Monitor for Complications</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Look for distension, leakage, AD symptoms</li>
          <li>Report changes immediately</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Practical Tips for Daily Bladder Management</h3>

    <h3>When to Contact Your Healthcare Team</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Increased difficulty or pain with catheterization</li>
      <li>Persistent leakage or retention</li>
      <li>Signs of infection (pain, fever, cloudy urine)</li>
      <li>Blood in urine</li>
      <li>New or worsening AD symptoms</li>
      <li>Any concerns about your routine or equipment</li>

Always work closely with your healthcare team to adjust your plan as needed.</p>
    <h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Describe the impact of SCI on bladder function and daily management</li>
      <li>Identify appropriate emptying methods and rationale</li>
      <li>Implement practical strategies for a safe, effective routine</li>
      <li>Recognize signs of complications and when to seek help</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Assessment Questions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>What is the preferred bladder emptying method recommended by Australian guidelines for most with SCI?</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>A. Indwelling catheterization</li>
          <li>B. Intermittent catheterization</li>
          <li>C. Reflex voiding with pads</li>
          <li>D. Timed voiding only</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>Answer:</strong> B. Intermittent catheterization<br/>
        <em>Explanation:</em> Intermittent catheterization is preferred because it reduces infection risk and preserves bladder health better than indwelling catheters.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Which is NOT a recommended daily practice to help prevent UTIs after SCI?</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>A. Washing hands before and after catheterization</li>
          <li>B. Using sterile or clean technique as advised</li>
          <li>C. Drinking at least 1.5 to 2 litres of water daily</li>
          <li>D. Holding urine for as long as possible to avoid frequent catheterization</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>Answer:</strong> D. Holding urine for as long as possible to avoid frequent catheterization<br/>
        <em>Explanation:</em> Holding urine increases overdistension and infection risk. Regular emptying is essential.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Which symptom should prompt immediate contact with a healthcare provider?</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>A. Mild bladder leakage once a week</li>
          <li>B. Cloudy urine with fever and increased spasticity</li>
          <li>C. Slight delay in catheter insertion</li>
          <li>D. Mild urgency without other symptoms</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>Answer:</strong> B. Cloudy urine with fever and increased spasticity<br/>
        <em>Explanation:</em> This indicates possible UTI or serious complication needing prompt attention.
