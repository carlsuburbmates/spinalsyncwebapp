        <h2>What is Orthostatic Hypotension?</h2>
        <p>Orthostatic hypotension (OH) is a sudden drop in blood pressure upon standing or sitting up, leading to dizziness, fainting, and risk of falls. It is common in SCI due to impaired autonomic regulation and loss of muscle pump action.</p>
        <h3>Key Features</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Drop in systolic BP of {'>'}20 mmHg or diastolic BP of {'>'}10 mmHg within 3 minutes of standing</li>
          <li>Dizziness, lightheadedness, blurred vision, weakness</li>
          <li>Syncope (fainting), pallor, nausea</li>
          <li>Most severe in early rehab and after prolonged bed rest</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Risk Factors</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>High cervical/thoracic injury</li>
          <li>Prolonged immobility</li>
          <li>Dehydration, anemia, infection</li>
          <li>Medications (antihypertensives, diuretics)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Prevention and Management Strategies</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Gradual position changes (slowly raise head of bed, sit up in stages)</li>
          <li>Compression stockings and abdominal binders</li>
          <li>Ensure adequate hydration and salt intake</li>
          <li>Monitor BP before and after transfers</li>
          <li>Physical therapy: tilt table, standing frame</li>
          <li>Pharmacological: midodrine, fludrocortisone, salt tablets</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Emergency Protocol</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>If symptoms occur, immediately return patient to supine position</li>
          <li>Elevate legs if possible</li>
          <li>Monitor vital signs</li>
          <li>Assess for dehydration, infection, or medication effects</li>
          <li>Call for medical review if symptoms persist or patient loses consciousness</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Patient and Caregiver Education</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Recognize warning signs of OH</li>
          <li>Importance of slow position changes</li>
          <li>Use of compression garments and hydration</li>
          <li>Emergency response plan for syncope</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Summary: Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>OH is common and can be dangerous in SCI</li>
          <li>Prevention is best: slow mobilization, compression, hydration</li>
          <li>Immediate supine positioning is critical if symptoms occur</li>
          <li>Monitor BP and educate patients/caregivers</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Assessment Questions</h2>
        <div>
          <strong>Question 1:</strong> A patient with a C6 SCI complains of dizziness and blurred vision when sitting up in bed. Their BP drops from 120/80 to 95/60 mmHg within 2 minutes. What is the most appropriate immediate action?
          <ul>
            <li>A. Give midodrine immediately</li>
            <li>B. Return the patient to a supine position and elevate their legs</li>
            <li>C. Encourage the patient to drink water</li>
            <li>D. Call emergency services</li>
          </ul>
          <strong>Answer:</strong> B. Return the patient to a supine position and elevate their legs<br/>
          <em>Explanation:</em> The first response to OH is to restore cerebral perfusion by returning the patient to a supine position and elevating the legs. Medications and fluids are secondary interventions.
        </div>
        <div>
          <strong>Question 2:</strong> Which of the following is NOT a recommended prevention strategy for orthostatic hypotension in SCI?
          <ul>
            <li>A. Compression stockings and abdominal binders</li>
            <li>B. Rapid position changes from lying to standing</li>
            <li>C. Adequate hydration and salt intake</li>
            <li>D. Tilt table and standing frame therapy</li>
          </ul>
          <strong>Answer:</strong> B. Rapid position changes from lying to standing<br/>
          <em>Explanation:</em> Rapid position changes increase the risk of OH. Prevention requires slow, staged mobilization and use of compression and hydration strategies.
        </div>
        <div>
          <strong>Question 3:</strong> What is the diagnostic criteria for orthostatic hypotension?
          <ul>
            <li>A. Drop in systolic BP of {'>'}20 mmHg or diastolic BP of {'>'}10 mmHg within 3 minutes of standing</li>
            <li>B. BP below 100/60 mmHg at any time</li>
            <li>C. Dizziness and fainting only</li>
            <li>D. Heart rate increase of {'>'}30 bpm</li>
          </ul>
          <strong>Answer:</strong> A. Drop in systolic BP of {'>'}20 mmHg or diastolic BP of {'>'}10 mmHg within 3 minutes of standing<br/>
          <em>Explanation:</em> The diagnostic criteria for OH is a drop in systolic BP of {'>'}20 mmHg or diastolic BP of {'>'}10 mmHg within 3 minutes of standing. Other options are incorrect or incomplete.
