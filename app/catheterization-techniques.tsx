    <h1>Catheterization Techniques</h1>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> This module provides essential knowledge and practical guidance on catheterization techniques for individuals with spinal cord injury, focusing on safe and effective bladder management based on Australian clinical guidelines.</p>
    <h2>Introduction to Catheterization in Spinal Cord Injury</h2>
    <p>Catheterization is a vital part of bladder management for many people with spinal cord injury (SCI). Due to disrupted nerve communication between the brain and bladder, many individuals cannot empty their bladders completely or safely without assistance. Catheterization provides a reliable method to ensure complete bladder emptying, reduce infection risk, and maintain kidney health.</p>
    <p>This module covers the main types of catheterization used in SCI care, proper techniques, and safety considerations based on Australian clinical guidelines from NSW Health ACI, Queensland SCIS, and Spinal Cord Injury Australia.</p>
    <h3>Types of Catheterization</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Intermittent Catheterization (IC):</strong> Inserted several times per day to empty the bladder, then removed. Lower infection risk, preserves bladder function, best for those who can perform it independently or with help.</li>
      <li><strong>Indwelling Catheterization:</strong> Urethral or suprapubic, left in place continuously. Higher infection risk, requires careful hygiene and monitoring.</li>
      <li><strong>Condom Catheters (External Collection):</strong> External sheath for men who can void reflexively. Non-invasive, lower infection risk, only suitable for some men.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Clean Intermittent Catheterization (CIC) Technique</h3>
    <p>CIC is the preferred method for most people with SCI who are able to perform it. Here's the step-by-step process:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Wash hands thoroughly with soap and water</li>
      <li>Gather supplies: catheter, lubricant, clean towel, disposal container</li>
      <li>Find a comfortable, private location</li>
      <li>Position yourself comfortably (sitting, wheelchair, or lying down)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>For Men:</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Clean the head of the penis</li>
      <li>Apply lubricant to the catheter tip</li>
      <li>Hold penis straight up, insert catheter gently</li>
      <li>Advance until urine flows, then insert 2-3cm further</li>
      <li>Allow complete drainage</li>
      <li>Withdraw catheter slowly when urine stops</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>For Women:</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Clean genital area front to back</li>
      <li>Separate labia, identify urethral opening</li>
      <li>Apply lubricant to catheter tip</li>
      <li>Insert catheter gently</li>
      <li>Advance until urine flows, then insert 2-3cm further</li>
      <li>Allow complete drainage</li>
      <li>Remove catheter slowly when drainage stops</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Safety and Hygiene Considerations</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Always wash hands before and after</li>
      <li>Use clean technique at home</li>
      <li>Clean genital area before each catheterization</li>
      <li>Use single-use catheters or clean reusable ones properly</li>
      <li>Store catheters in a clean, dry place</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Signs of Complications:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Difficulty inserting catheter</li>
      <li>Blood in urine</li>
      <li>Signs of UTI (fever, cloudy urine, odor, spasticity)</li>
      <li>Pain or discomfort during catheterization</li>
      <li>Sudden changes in urine volume or characteristics</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Catheter Selection and Equipment</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Material: PVC, silicone, or latex (if no allergies)</li>
      <li>Size: Usually 12-16 French for adults</li>
      <li>Features: Some have hydrophilic coating</li>
      <li>Additional: Lubricant, wipes, towels, disposal bags, mirror</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Troubleshooting Common Issues</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Catheter won't insert: Ensure lubrication, relax, change position, don't force, seek help if needed</li>
      <li>Incomplete emptying: Insert far enough, change position, gently press bladder, wait for drainage</li>
      <li>Frequent infections: Review technique, consider catheter changes, increase fluids, discuss with doctor</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>When to Contact Your Healthcare Team</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Signs of UTI</li>
      <li>Blood in urine</li>
      <li>Inability to insert catheter</li>
      <li>Severe pain during catheterization</li>
      <li>Signs of autonomic dysreflexia</li>
      <li>Any concerns about your routine</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Identify the main types of catheterization and their appropriate uses in SCI management</li>
      <li>Demonstrate proper clean intermittent catheterization technique</li>
      <li>Implement effective hygiene and safety measures to prevent complications</li>
      <li>Recognize signs of problems requiring medical attention</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Assessment Questions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>What is the preferred catheterization method for most people with SCI who are able to perform it?</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>A. Indwelling urethral catheter</li>
          <li>B. Suprapubic catheter</li>
          <li>C. Clean intermittent catheterization</li>
          <li>D. Condom catheter</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>Answer:</strong> C. Clean intermittent catheterization<br/>
        <em>Explanation:</em> Clean intermittent catheterization is preferred because it has a lower infection risk than indwelling catheters and allows for more normal bladder function while ensuring complete emptying.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>How often should intermittent catheterization typically be performed?</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>A. Once daily</li>
          <li>B. Every 2-3 hours</li>
          <li>C. Every 4-6 hours</li>
          <li>D. Only when feeling the urge to urinate</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>Answer:</strong> C. Every 4-6 hours<br/>
        <em>Explanation:</em> Most people need to perform intermittent catheterization every 4-6 hours to prevent bladder overdistension and maintain optimal bladder health.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>What should you do if you cannot insert the catheter during a routine catheterization?</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>A. Force the catheter in using more pressure</li>
          <li>B. Skip this catheterization and try again later</li>
          <li>C. Ensure adequate lubrication and try relaxation techniques; seek help if problems persist</li>
          <li>D. Use a larger catheter size</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>Answer:</strong> C. Ensure adequate lubrication and try relaxation techniques; seek help if problems persist<br/>
        <em>Explanation:</em> Never force catheter insertion. First check lubrication and positioning, then seek medical advice if insertion remains difficult to prevent injury.
