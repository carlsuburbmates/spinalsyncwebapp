        <h2>Introduction to Breathing Techniques and Exercises</h2>
        <p>Breathing exercises are a cornerstone of respiratory care after spinal cord injury. These techniques help maximize the function of remaining respiratory muscles, improve lung capacity, prevent complications, and enhance overall respiratory health. This module provides step-by-step instructions for key breathing exercises based on Australian clinical guidelines.</p>
        <h3>Benefits of Breathing Exercises After SCI</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Improve lung capacity and chest wall mobility</li>
          <li>Strengthen remaining respiratory muscles</li>
          <li>Enhance secretion clearance and reduce infection risk</li>
          <li>Reduce respiratory fatigue and breathlessness</li>
          <li>Improve sleep quality and reduce sleep apnea</li>
          <li>Support cardiovascular health</li>
          <li>Increase confidence and independence in respiratory management</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Core Breathing Techniques</h3>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Diaphragmatic Breathing:</strong> Lie flat or sit comfortably, hand on chest and abdomen, breathe in slowly through nose, abdomen rises, exhale through pursed lips. Repeat 5-10 minutes, 2-3 times daily.</li>
          <li><strong>Glossopharyngeal Breathing (Frog Breathing):</strong> Use tongue and throat muscles to "gulp" air into lungs. Practice under supervision.</li>
          <li><strong>Incentive Spirometry:</strong> Use spirometer, inhale slowly and deeply, hold breath, exhale, repeat 10-15 times every hour while awake.</li>
          <li><strong>Pursed-Lip Breathing:</strong> Inhale through nose, purse lips, exhale slowly through pursed lips. Repeat as needed.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Chest Expansion and Mobility Exercises</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Chest Wall Stretching:</strong> Raise arms overhead while inhaling, hold, lower arms while exhaling. Repeat 5-10 times.</li>
          <li><strong>Trunk Rotation:</strong> Rotate trunk to each side while exhaling, return to center while inhaling. Repeat 5 times each direction.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Coughing Techniques and Airway Clearance</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Assisted Cough (Quad Cough):</strong> Caregiver pushes below rib cage during cough effort.</li>
          <li><strong>Huffing Technique:</strong> Take deep breath, make "huff" sound, use abdominal muscles, follow with gentle cough.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Advanced Techniques</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Breath Stacking:</strong> Take normal breath, hold, stack additional breaths, cough or exhale forcefully.</li>
          <li><strong>Air Shifting:</strong> Breathe into different lung areas by changing position.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Exercise Progression and Safety</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Start with 5-10 minutes, 2-3 times daily, increase as tolerated</li>
          <li>Stop if dizziness, chest pain, or unusual shortness of breath</li>
          <li>Perform exercises when well, avoid during infection unless advised</li>
          <li>Use clean equipment, wash hands</li>
          <li>Monitor oxygen saturation if available</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Positioning for Optimal Breathing</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Upright sitting (90°) best for most exercises</li>
          <li>Semi-reclined (45-60°) alternative</li>
          <li>Side-lying for air shifting</li>
          <li>Avoid flat, slouched, or compressed positions</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>When to Seek Help</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Increased difficulty with exercises</li>
          <li>New or worsening shortness of breath</li>
          <li>Changes in secretions or cough</li>
          <li>Dizziness or chest pain during exercises</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Integration with Daily Activities</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Practice before meals</li>
          <li>Use during transfers or position changes</li>
          <li>Incorporate into daily routines</li>
          <li>Use during stressful situations</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Assessment Questions</h2>
        <div>
          <strong>Question 1:</strong> Which breathing technique is most appropriate for a person with a high cervical spinal cord injury (C3-C5) who has limited diaphragm function?
          <ul>
            <li>A. Diaphragmatic breathing</li>
            <li>B. Glossopharyngeal breathing ("frog breathing")</li>
            <li>C. Pursed-lip breathing</li>
            <li>D. Incentive spirometry</li>
          </ul>
          <strong>Answer:</strong> B. Glossopharyngeal breathing ("frog breathing")<br/>
          <em>Explanation:</em> Glossopharyngeal breathing uses the mouth and throat muscles to "gulp" air into the lungs and is particularly useful for individuals with high cervical injuries who have weak or absent diaphragm function. The other techniques require more diaphragm control.
        </div>
        <div>
          <strong>Question 2:</strong> What is the primary purpose of incentive spirometry in people with spinal cord injury?
          <ul>
            <li>A. To strengthen abdominal muscles</li>
            <li>B. To encourage deep inhalation and prevent lung collapse</li>
            <li>C. To improve cough effectiveness</li>
            <li>D. To assist with airway suctioning</li>
          </ul>
          <strong>Answer:</strong> B. To encourage deep inhalation and prevent lung collapse<br/>
          <em>Explanation:</em> Incentive spirometry encourages slow, deep breaths to promote lung expansion and prevent atelectasis (lung collapse). While it may indirectly support other functions, its primary goal is maintaining lung inflation.
        </div>
        <div>
          <strong>Question 3:</strong> Which sign indicates a need to seek urgent medical assessment for respiratory complications during breathing exercises?
          <ul>
            <li>A. Mild fatigue after completing exercises</li>
            <li>B. Chest pain or unusual shortness of breath during exercises</li>
            <li>C. Slight increase in secretion clearance</li>
            <li>D. Feeling refreshed after exercises</li>
          </ul>
          <strong>Answer:</strong> B. Chest pain or unusual shortness of breath during exercises<br/>
          <em>Explanation:</em> Chest pain or unusual shortness of breath during exercises may indicate complications and requires immediate medical attention. Mild fatigue and increased secretion clearance are often normal responses.
