        <h2>Introduction to Pain After Spinal Cord Injury</h2>
        <p>Pain is one of the most common and challenging complications following spinal cord injury, affecting up to 80% of individuals with SCI. Many experience significant pain that can impact their physical function, emotional well-being, and overall quality of life.</p>
        <h3>Types of Pain After SCI</h3>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Neuropathic Pain:</strong> Burning, shooting, stabbing, or electric shock-like pain due to nervous system damage. Can occur at, above, or below the injury level.</li>
          <li><strong>Nociceptive Pain:</strong> Aching, stiff, cramping, or throbbing pain from tissue damage or inflammation. Includes musculoskeletal and visceral pain.</li>
          <li><strong>Mixed Pain:</strong> Combinations of neuropathic and nociceptive pain.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Factors Affecting Pain After SCI</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Injury-related: Level, completeness, time since injury, syringomyelia</li>
          <li>Individual: Age, pre-existing conditions, psychological factors, sleep, activity, coping, support</li>
          <li>Environmental/Lifestyle: Weather, temperature, stress, sleep, activity, social support</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Impact of Pain on Daily Life</h3>

        </ul>
        <h3>Pain Assessment</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Numeric Rating Scale (0-10): 0 = No pain, 1-3 = Mild, 4-6 = Moderate, 7-10 = Severe</li>
          <li>Descriptive words: burning, shooting, aching, cramping, throbbing</li>
          <li>Pain diary: Track triggers, activities, patterns, medication effectiveness</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>When Pain Becomes a Problem</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Pain interferes with daily activities or sleep</li>
          <li>Increasing pain intensity or frequency</li>
          <li>New types of pain or changes in existing pain</li>
          <li>Pain prevents participation in rehabilitation or work</li>
          <li>Mood changes or depression related to pain</li>
          <li>Pain not responding to usual management strategies</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Myths and Misconceptions About Pain in SCI</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Myth: People with complete SCI can't feel pain. Reality: Pain can occur above, at, or below the injury level.</li>
          <li>Myth: Pain after SCI is just psychological. Reality: Pain has real physiological causes and needs treatment.</li>
          <li>Myth: You just have to live with the pain. Reality: Effective management strategies exist.</li>
          <li>Myth: Strong pain medications are the only solution. Reality: Management often involves multiple approaches.</li>
