        <h2>Introduction to Pressure Injuries and SCI</h2>
        <p>Pressure injuries (also known as pressure ulcers, bed sores, or pressure sores) are areas of damaged skin and underlying tissue caused by prolonged pressure, shear, or friction. For people with spinal cord injury, pressure injuries are one of the most serious and preventable complications, with potentially life-threatening consequences if not properly managed.</p>
        <p>After SCI, the combination of reduced sensation, impaired mobility, and other physiological changes significantly increases the risk of developing pressure injuries. Understanding these risk factors and prevention strategies is essential for maintaining skin health and avoiding serious complications.</p>
        <h3>What Are Pressure Injuries?</h3>
        <p>Pressure injuries occur when prolonged pressure reduces blood flow to tissues, leading to cell death and tissue breakdown. They can develop in as little as 30 minutes under certain conditions and may take months or years to heal completely.</p>
        <h3>Pressure Injury Staging (Australian Standards)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Stage 1: Non-blanchable red area on intact skin</li>
          <li>Stage 2: Partial thickness skin loss with visible dermis</li>
          <li>Stage 3: Full thickness skin loss extending into subcutaneous tissue</li>
          <li>Stage 4: Full thickness skin and tissue loss exposing muscle, tendon, or bone</li>
          <li>Unstageable: Tissue obscured by slough or eschar</li>
          <li>Deep Tissue Injury: Intact or non-intact skin with localized area of persistent non-blanchable deep red, maroon, or purple discoloration</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Why Are People with SCI at Higher Risk?</h3>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Loss of Sensation:</strong> Inability to feel pain, pressure, or discomfort below the injury level</li>
          <li><strong>Reduced Mobility:</strong> Paralysis or weakness limits ability to change positions independently</li>
          <li><strong>Impaired Circulation:</strong> Altered blood flow patterns below the injury level</li>
          <li><strong>Autonomic Changes:</strong> Altered sweating, blood vessel function, temperature regulation</li>
          <li><strong>Nutritional Factors:</strong> Healing requires adequate protein, vitamins, minerals</li>
          <li><strong>Spasticity and Contractures:</strong> Muscle spasms and contractures can cause friction, shear, and pressure points</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Common Pressure Injury Sites in SCI</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Sitting:</strong> Sacrum, coccyx, ischial tuberosities, greater trochanter, heels, ankles</li>
          <li><strong>Lying:</strong> Sacrum, coccyx, scapulae, occiput, elbows, heels</li>
          <li><strong>Side-Lying:</strong> Greater trochanter, lateral malleolus, ear, shoulder</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Risk Factors Specific to SCI</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Medical: Level/completeness, time since injury, history, comorbidities, infection, moisture, cognition</li>
          <li>Lifestyle: Nutrition, hydration, smoking, alcohol, pressure relief, hygiene, seating/bedding</li>
          <li>Environmental: Hard surfaces, wrinkled linens, devices, temperature, humidity</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>The Cost of Pressure Injuries</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Personal: Pain, delayed rehab, hospital stays, impact on life, psychological effects, reduced quality of life</li>
          <li>Healthcare: High treatment costs, extended stays, increased resource use, legal implications</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Risk Assessment Tools</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Braden Scale: Sensory perception, moisture, activity, mobility, nutrition, friction/shear</li>
          <li>Waterlow Scale: Additional risk factors</li>
          <li>SCI-specific: Scales may underestimate risk; clinical judgment and regular reassessment are essential</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Prevention Principles (Australian Guidelines)</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Risk identification and assessment</li>
          <li>Skin inspection and monitoring</li>
          <li>Pressure redistribution and relief</li>
          <li>Skin care and hygiene</li>
          <li>Nutrition and hydration optimization</li>
          <li>Education and support</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Early Warning Signs</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Stage 1: Non-blanchable red area, warm/cool, firm/soft, pain/itching (if sensation present)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>What to Do if You Find a Red Area</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Relieve all pressure immediately</li>
          <li>Document location, size, appearance</li>
          <li>Monitor for changes</li>
          <li>Contact healthcare provider if no improvement in 24-48 hours</li>
          <li>Take photos to track changes</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>When to Seek Medical Attention</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Any open wound or skin breakdown</li>
          <li>Red areas that don't improve</li>
          <li>Signs of infection (pain, warmth, swelling, drainage, fever)</li>
          <li>Worsening wounds</li>
          <li>New areas of concern</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Regular Healthcare Visits</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Annual skin assessments</li>
          <li>Review prevention strategies</li>
          <li>Equipment assessment</li>
          <li>Education reinforcement</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>Understanding pressure injury risk is the foundation of prevention. People with SCI face significantly higher risks due to multiple factors including loss of sensation, reduced mobility, and physiological changes. However, with proper knowledge, consistent prevention practices, and appropriate support, most pressure injuries can be prevented.</p>
        <p>The key is to adopt a proactive approach focusing on daily skin inspection, regular pressure relief, appropriate support surfaces, and maintaining overall health. Prevention is always more effective, less costly, and less disruptive than treatment.</p>

        <h2>Assessment Questions</h2>
        <div>
          <strong>Question 1:</strong> Which factor makes individuals with SCI most vulnerable to developing pressure injuries?
          <ul>
            <li>A. Increased appetite leading to weight gain</li>
            <li>B. Loss of sensation below the injury level combined with reduced mobility</li>
            <li>C. Improved circulation below the injury level</li>
            <li>D. Enhanced ability to feel pressure and pain</li>
          </ul>
          <strong>Answer:</strong> B. Loss of sensation below the injury level combined with reduced mobility<br/>
          <em>Explanation:</em> The combination of loss of sensation (inability to feel pain or pressure) and reduced mobility (inability to reposition independently) creates the highest risk for pressure injury development in SCI. This prevents natural protective responses.
        </div>
        <div>
          <strong>Question 2:</strong> What characterizes a Stage 1 pressure injury?
          <ul>
            <li>A. Full thickness skin loss exposing muscle</li>
            <li>B. Partial thickness skin loss with visible dermis</li>
            <li>C. Non-blanchable red area on intact skin</li>
            <li>D. Tissue obscured by slough or eschar</li>
          </ul>
          <strong>Answer:</strong> C. Non-blanchable red area on intact skin<br/>
          <em>Explanation:</em> Stage 1 pressure injuries present as non-blanchable (doesn't turn white when pressed) red areas on intact skin. This is the earliest stage and the most treatable if identified promptly.
        </div>
        <div>
          <strong>Question 3:</strong> According to Australian clinical guidelines, what should be done immediately if a red area is discovered during skin inspection?
          <ul>
            <li>A. Apply heat to increase circulation</li>
            <li>B. Massage the area vigorously</li>
            <li>C. Relieve all pressure from the area immediately</li>
            <li>D. Cover with a tight bandage</li>
          </ul>
          <strong>Answer:</strong> C. Relieve all pressure from the area immediately<br/>
          <em>Explanation:</em> The immediate priority is to relieve all pressure from the affected area to prevent further tissue damage. Heat, massage, and tight coverings can worsen the condition and are not recommended.
