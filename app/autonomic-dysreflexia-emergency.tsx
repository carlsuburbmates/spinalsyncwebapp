        <h2>Emergency Alert: Autonomic Dysreflexia is a Life-Threatening Medical Emergency</h2>
        <p>Autonomic Dysreflexia (AD) is an uncontrolled, massive sympathetic nervous system response that occurs in individuals with spinal cord injuries at or above T6. This condition can cause blood pressure to rise to dangerous levels within minutes, potentially resulting in stroke, seizures, cardiac arrest, or death if not promptly recognized and treated.</p>
        <h3>Understanding the Pathophysiology</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Trigger event below injury level (bladder, bowel, skin)</li>
          <li>Massive sympathetic activation and vasoconstriction</li>
            <li>Hypertension crisis: BP can rise {'>'}200/100 mmHg</li>
          <li>Compensatory bradycardia and flushing above injury</li>
          <li>Failed compensation below injury level</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Classic Signs and Symptoms</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Severe headache</li>
          <li>Profuse sweating above injury</li>
          <li>Sudden severe hypertension</li>
          <li>Facial flushing, nasal congestion, bradycardia</li>
          <li>Anxiety, blurred vision, chest tightness, nausea</li>
          <li>Pallor below injury</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Emergency Response Protocol</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Sit patient upright immediately</li>
          <li>Loosen restrictive clothing</li>
          <li>Check vital signs (BP, HR)</li>
          <li>Systematic trigger identification: bladder, bowel, skin, other</li>
          <li>Bladder: check catheter, drainage, distension</li>
          <li>Bowel: check for impaction</li>

          <li>Unable to identify/remove trigger</li>
          <li>Patient deterioration despite treatment</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Prevention Strategies</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Regular bladder/bowel care</li>
          <li>Daily skin inspection</li>
          <li>Avoid tight clothing/devices</li>
          <li>Monitor for infection</li>
          <li>Pre-medication for high-risk procedures</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Patient and Caregiver Education</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Recognition of warning signs</li>
          <li>Immediate response actions</li>
          <li>Emergency action plan and medication</li>
          <li>Medical alert identification</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Summary: Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>AD is always a medical emergency</li>
          <li>Elevation and trigger removal are critical</li>
          <li>Don't hesitate to call emergency services</li>
          <li>Prevention is best</li>

        <h2>Assessment Questions</h2>
        <div>
          <strong>Question 1:</strong> A patient with a T5 complete SCI suddenly develops a severe headache, profuse sweating on their face and neck, and their blood pressure rises from 110/70 to 180/100 mmHg. What is the MOST important immediate action?
          <ul>
            <li>A. Administer sublingual nifedipine immediately</li>
            <li>B. Lay the patient flat and elevate their legs</li>
            <li>C. Sit the patient upright and loosen any restrictive clothing</li>
            <li>D. Check their temperature for fever</li>
          </ul>
          <strong>Answer:</strong> C. Sit the patient upright and loosen any restrictive clothing<br/>
          <em>Explanation:</em> The first and most critical intervention for autonomic dysreflexia is positioning - sitting the patient upright uses gravity to help lower blood pressure. Loosening restrictive clothing removes potential triggers. Laying flat would worsen hypertension, and medications should only be used after positioning and trigger identification.
        </div>
        <div>
          <strong>Question 2:</strong> After sitting a patient upright for suspected autonomic dysreflexia, what should be your systematic approach to identifying triggers?
          <ul>
            <li>A. Check skin first, then bowel, then bladder</li>
            <li>B. Check bladder first, then bowel, then skin and other causes</li>
            <li>C. Check bowel first, then skin, then bladder</li>
            <li>D. Start with medications before looking for triggers</li>
          </ul>
          <strong>Answer:</strong> B. Check bladder first, then bowel, then skin and other causes<br/>
          <em>Explanation:</em> Bladder-related issues cause 85% of AD episodes, making it the most likely trigger. The systematic approach should be bladder (catheter patency, distension), then bowel (impaction), then skin (pressure injuries, tight clothing), then other less common causes.
        </div>
        <div>
          <strong>Question 3:</strong> When should emergency services (000) be called for a patient experiencing autonomic dysreflexia?
          <ul>
            <li>A. Only when blood pressure exceeds 250/120 mmHg</li>
            <li>B. When blood pressure remains {'>'}200/100 mmHg after 20 minutes despite treatment, or if neurological symptoms develop</li>
            <li>C. Only if the patient loses consciousness</li>
            <li>D. After trying all medications first</li>
          </ul>
          <strong>Answer:</strong> B. When blood pressure remains {'>'}200/100 mmHg after 20 minutes despite treatment, or if neurological symptoms develop<br/>
          <em>Explanation:</em> Emergency services should be called when blood pressure remains severely elevated despite proper treatment, when neurological complications suggest impending stroke, or when the patient shows signs of deterioration. Waiting for extreme elevations or loss of consciousness delays critical care.
